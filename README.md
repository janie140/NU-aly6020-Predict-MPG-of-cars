Introduction

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually supplies crucial fuel economy data to federal agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This data, sourced from comprehensive vehicle testing at the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and submissions from manufacturers, forms the basis for fuel economy-related programs. This analysis focuses on applying Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to EPA-provided data, specifically examining the MPG (miles per gallon), the variable "RND_ADJ_FE," representing lab-tested fuel efficiency in this dataset.
